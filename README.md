## Detailed Code Explanation

### 1. `app.py` - Main Application Logic

This file serves as the main interface for the application, providing users with options to add a face to the database or verify an existing face. Letâ€™s go over each part of this file.

### Code Snippets and Explanations

```python
import cv2
import database
from face_recognition import detect_faces, process_face, is_match

```

- **Imports**: Imports OpenCV for camera handling, `database` for managing MySQL interactions, and `detect_faces`, `process_face`, and `is_match` from `face_recognition.py` to detect, embed, and compare faces.

### Face Loading Function

```python
def load_face():
    """Capture an image from the camera, detect the face, and store the embedding in the database."""
    try:
        cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
        if not cap.isOpened():
            print("Error accessing the camera.")
            return

```

- **Purpose**: Captures an image from the camera and attempts to detect a face.
- **Explanation**: This function first checks if the camera is accessible; if not, it outputs an error.

```python
        # Capture a single frame from the camera
        ret, frame = cap.read()
        if not ret:
            print("Failed to capture image from camera.")
            cap.release()
            return

```

- **Purpose**: Captures a single frame, releases the camera if unsuccessful.
- **Explanation**: Captures one frame from the camera, which will be analyzed for face detection.

```python
        faces = detect_faces(frame)
        if len(faces) > 0:
            face_embedding = process_face(frame, faces[0])

```

- **Face Detection and Embedding**: Calls the `detect_faces()` function (from `face_recognition.py`) to locate faces, then processes the detected face to generate its embedding.

---

### 2. `face_recognition.py` - Face Detection and Embedding Generation

This file handles the core functionality: face detection, embedding generation using the ArcFace model, and comparison for verification.

### Code Snippets and Explanations

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np
import onnxruntime as ort
from numpy.linalg import norm

```

- **Imports**: OpenCV for face detection, NumPy for array manipulations, ONNX for ArcFace model inference, and `norm` for calculating the distance between embeddings.

### Loading the ArcFace Model

```python
model_path = 'model/arcface.onnx'
session = ort.InferenceSession(model_path)

```

- **ArcFace Model**: Loads the ArcFace model, which has been pre-trained for face recognition. ArcFace generates 512-dimensional embeddings for faces, providing unique "fingerprints" that make matching effective.
- **ONNX Runtime**: Using ONNX Runtime allows for optimized and efficient inference, crucial for real-time applications.

### Face Detection Function

```python
def detect_faces(image):
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray, scaleFactor=1.1, minNeighbors=5)
    return faces

```

- **Face Detection with Haar Cascade**: Converts the image to grayscale (which improves detection accuracy) and detects faces using Haar Cascade.
- **Explanation**: This function returns the coordinates of faces in the image.

### Embedding Generation with ArcFace

```python
def get_face_embedding(face_pixels):
    face_pixels = face_pixels.astype('float32')
    face_pixels = cv2.resize(face_pixels, (112, 112))  # ArcFace input size
    face_pixels = np.expand_dims(face_pixels, axis=0)
    face_pixels = np.transpose(face_pixels, (0, 3, 1, 2))  # Change to NCHW format
    face_pixels = (face_pixels - 127.5) / 128.0  # Normalize

```

- **Explanation**:
    - **NumPy Array**: Converts face pixels to `float32` for compatibility with the model.
    - **Resize and Normalize**: The image is resized to 112x112 pixels (ArcFace requirement) and normalized to ensure consistency.
    - **Format Transformation**: The input is reshaped to match the ArcFace input format (NCHW).
    - **Normalization**: By scaling pixel values, the embedding generation becomes more consistent, crucial for accurate matching.

```python
    input_name = session.get_inputs()[0].name
    embedding = session.run(None, {input_name: face_pixels})[0]
    return embedding[0]

```

- **Model Inference**: Feeds the processed image into the ArcFace model to generate the embedding.
- **Purpose**: Returns a unique 512-dimensional embedding representing the face.

### Face Comparison Function

```python
def is_match(embedding1, embedding2, threshold=0.8):
    embedding1 = embedding1 / norm(embedding1)
    embedding2 = embedding2 / norm(embedding2)
    distance = norm(embedding1 - embedding2)
    return distance < threshold

```

- **Explanation**:
    - **Normalization**: Ensures embeddings are comparable.
    - **Distance Calculation**: Uses cosine distance to determine the similarity, with a threshold (0.8) to identify a match.

### 3. `db_setup.py` - Database Setup

```python
import mysql.connector

def setup_database():
    conn = connect_db()
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS face_recognition_db")
    cursor.execute("USE face_recognition_db")
    cursor.execute("""
        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS faces (
            id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
            name VARCHAR(255),
            embedding BLOB
        )
    """)
    conn.commit()
    cursor.close()
    conn.close()

```

- **Purpose**: Initializes the database and creates a `faces` table to store face embeddings as BLOBs (Binary Large Objects), ensuring efficient storage and retrieval.

---

### 4. `database.py` - Database Operations

Handles database operations like saving and retrieving face embeddings.

### Code Snippets and Explanations

```python
def store_face_embedding(name, embedding):
    conn = connect_db()
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    embedding_bytes = embedding.tobytes()
    query = "INSERT INTO faces (name, embedding) VALUES (%s, %s)"
    cursor.execute(query, (name, embedding_bytes))
    conn.commit()
    cursor.close()
    conn.close()

```

- **Purpose**: Converts the NumPy embedding to bytes for storage and saves it in the database.
